# Raspberry-Pi
Raspberry Pi A to Z List
**Basics Raspberry Pi**
The Raspberry Pi was originally designed for educational purposes to use in schools and universities, and to make class and study more interesting.
Unfortunately, the practical use of the Raspberry Pi or a comparable single-board computer in Germany, Austria and Switzerland is still in its infancy. Listening to the topic, you will find only a few examples showing the use of the Raspberry Pi in school, in education or in study.
The following tasks and exercises should help a little here. They are suitable for self-study or as a source for teachers and faculty to build their own Raspberry Pi workshop. The tasks also include exemplary ready-made solutions.
